This is a game that I have been writing for a while, it should be done! Find a problem? Please let me know! :)

For best result, I recommend running this from the terminal using the `make` command.

Also note: In the game, in addition to the options listed, you can also enter the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`, or the word `all` to select an option.
With these, priority is given to the highest scoring options available.
